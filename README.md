# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past ratings.  
It uses **machine learning techniques** to analyze user-movie interactions and provide **personalized movie recommendations**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The system utilizes a **content-based and collaborative filtering** approach using the **scikit-learn (sklearn)** library.  
It processes large-scale movie rating data to predict how much a user might like a movie they haven’t seen yet.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is from **Kaggle** and contains:
- **Movies.csv** → Movie details (title, genres)
- **Ratings.csv** → User ratings for movies

**Data Size Example:**
- Movies: 62,423  
- Ratings: 25,000,095  

Due to its size, the dataset is processed efficiently using **sparse matrices**.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Large dataset handling with sparse matrices  
- Movie similarity computation using cosine similarity  
- Personalized recommendations for each user  
- Fast and memory-efficient data loading  
- Implemented using **Python & scikit-learn**
